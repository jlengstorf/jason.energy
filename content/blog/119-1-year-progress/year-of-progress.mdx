title: A Year of Steady Progress Is More Than I Expected

description: >
  I never feel like I'm doing enough. But I looked at what I was doing a year ago and... it was kind of a shock how much changed. There's a lesson in here.

In November 2023, I launched <Fn id="series-4d1a">_4 Web Devs 1 App Idea_.</Fn>. This was the [first in a series](https://codetv.link/4d1a) that would lead to [_Web Dev Challenge_](https://codetv.link/wdc).

	This series is my spin on a YouTube format created (I think) by [Jessica Kobeissi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMHISHSRJwdYhG0YFufX84EfvZbKZGoDh) and popularized by [Andrew Huang](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW9UYOmoXTQmEQecw3OwifUBEWCrMf625).

Launching this show was an emotional journey that deserves its own post, but for now I want to celebrate something that I tend to forget: **[constant, gentle pressure](/constant-gentle-pressure/) gets us so much further than a single, heroic push ever could.**

## I knew where I wanted to go, but I started where I was

A large and consistent challenge for me whenever I have a new idea is that I can see further than I can throw. I have a vision of something amazing and perfect (and complicated and incredibly expensive) — and because I can imagine what my ideal version of The Big Idea™ is, I get frustrated when it's all too often out of my reach.

_4 Web Devs, 1 App Idea_ was not my ideal version of The Big Idea™. But it was the version I could make at the time. And I knew that if I wanted to get closer to the ideal, I needed to prove that The Big Idea™ worked in the first place — so <Fn id="scope">I scoped down and did what I could with the tools I had.</Fn>

<FnText id="scope">
	I'm telling the story like I was super logical and reasonable about this, but my friends and family know I spent _months_ stubbornly refusing to do a "worse" version, then raged when other people shipped vaguely similar things that I felt I could have done better, then despaired when I looked at my progress and realized I hadn't shipped anything in months.
  
  Everyone around me gave fantastic advice that I steadfastly ignored ("advice like that works for everyone else but _obviously I am different!_").
  
  When I finally chose to make the version I was able to make at the time, I did so like a sullen teenager being dragged to a family function they feel way too cool to attend.

- I reached out to [Eve](https://www.moonhighway.com/about), [Scott](https://tolin.ski/), and [Salma](https://whitep4nth3r.com/) first because I knew they were comfortable recording themselves
- I asked everyone to work asynchronously to make it less complicated and demanding on everyone's schedule
- My editor and I worked to combine the asynchronous footage into something that felt as close as we could manage to the full group sharing in a room together

These choices kept production costs manageable, and allowed me to make the case to [Clerk](https://codetv.link/clerk) that trying a non-traditional approach to developer content was an acceptable risk. Their former head of devrel, [Domitrius Clark](https://bsky.app/profile/domitri.us), believed in the vision and got the rest of his team on board to sponsor four episodes — one of those "huge in retrospect" moments that has affected so much of what I've done professionally since.

## Unfortunately, doing stuff is the only way we get better at stuff

When I published the episode on Novemer 16, I was proud of it — but I knew there were ways to improve.

In subsequent episodes, I tried new things, like recording everyone on a call instead of asynchronously. Each little improvement led to a slightly better end product that was a little bit closer to The Big Idea™.

I was _iterating_, like I always tell everyone else to do, and relearning the lesson that **[the best way to get really good at a thing is to consistently do the thing for a long time.](/show-up-do-the-work/)**

Between November 16, 2023 and March 13, 2024, I published six episodes of _4 Web Devs, 1 App Idea_. Each one was a little better than the one before, and each time I looked for little ways to improve next time.

## The success of the first version paved the way for the next

Even more than iterative improvement, **shipping consistently helped me prove the value of the idea and my ability to deliver on it.**

And that proof helped me make a compelling enough case to convince a partner to support the next iteration of this idea — another step closer to The Big Idea™.

In yet another confirmation that [doing good work is a pie-eating contest where the prize for winning is more pie](/more-pie/), less than five weeks after the episode went live, I was in conversations with [DataStax](https://codetv.link/datastax) about The Big Idea™, and by March 2024 we'd reached an agreement to create the first episode of [_Web Dev Challenge_](https://codetv.link/wdc), an upgraded, in-person successor to _4 Web Devs, 1 App Idea_.

We filmed the first episode in April. _Web Dev Challenge_ officially went live on my birthday, June 26.

Since its initial launch, I've gone on to record 10 episodes for season 1 of _Web Dev Challenge_. I'm in talks for season 2. (If your company wants to get involved, [I want to work with you](https://partners.codetv.dev)!)

And I'm not done yet.

## The Big Idea™ is still a few steps away

**Nov 16, 2023 is when the first episode of _4 Web Devs, 1 App Idea_ went live — but this was <Fn id="backstory">a journey I started years earlier.</Fn>**

<FnText id="backstory">
  I first started developing The Big Idea™ in 2019. When I worked at Netlify as an individual contributor, I made the pitch to my leadership team, but I couldn't manage to get it prioritized. When I was promoted to VP at Netlify in 2021, I redoubled my efforts but didn't manage to survive The Spreadsheet. Two years later [I went full-time on video production](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/full-time-learn-with-jason) and started pitching The Big Idea™ to partners across the tech industry — but I still couldn't get anyone to see what I saw (or, at least, not well enough to make it into the budget).
</FnText>

I am incredibly proud of how far things have come since that first episode dropped. But I'm still not where I want to be with it.

That being said, it's the best version it can be _right now_ — and hopefully in another year I'll be able to share another update with even more progress.

**I've got big ideas and I can't wait for you to see them.**
