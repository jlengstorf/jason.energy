                This swapped out a bunch of boilerplate code for a package that
                handled security compliance, deployment, and other configuration
                that was always the same but — for whatever reason —&nbsp;was
                being copy-pasted by every team in the organization. And when a
                policy changed, <em>every single team</em> needed to make manual
                changes. Not to mention someone had to own reviewing every
                team's work to make sure the changes were done correctly.

              <p>
                Our solution packaged up all of that copy-pasted configuration
                and manual review into a single source of truth that could be
                centrally managed. Each team could replace a huge chunk of their
                code with this package, and then they'd never need to manually
                update or review the boilerplate stuff again.

            <strong
              >In our lives, our careers, and our relationships, we're able to
              intentionally create outcomes through deliberate effort. But we
              <em>also</em> have plenty of things that emerge in our lives
              without any conscious input — they drift into existence over
              time.</strong

          <p>
            My first instinct was to make a plan to prevent things from
            drifting. After all, anything we're not intentional about is a risk,
            right? I want to be the author of my own story, and the idea of just
            <em>letting things happen</em> feels like handing over control.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first problem with this is that it's completely unrealistic to
            try and be intentional about everything. There are too many moving
            parts, too many variables, and too much context for it to be
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            But beyond that, Dan said something about design systems that
            changed how I think about things now:
            <strong
              >letting people solve problems and identifying patterns before
              acting, rather than trying to predict behavior in unknown
              scenarios, leads to better outcomes.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's talk about that using the shorthand "intention" and "drift".

            This is what we talk about almost exclusively in the context of
            personal development and business alike. We research; we plan; we
            execute. In fact, prior to this conversation, I'm fairly convinced I
            thought <em>only</em> intentional work would lead to any meaningful
            outcome.

            I spent the majority of my life as a firm believer in The Plan™. I
            created The Plan™ and I needed to Follow The Plan™ and I would
            achieve Success According To The Plan™.

            If I tally up the pivotal moments for myself, however, I can't help
            but acknowledge that — both professionally and personally —

            In fact, a few of the <em>most</em> pivotal moments in my life
            resulted from drifting:

              I learned to code because I was in a band and needed to build a
              website and customize our MySpace page. When the band broke up, I
              realized I'd accidentally built enough of a skill set to work
              professionally as a web developer.

              was a happy accident. I was experimenting with ideas for how to be
              more transparent about my work, and invited
              <a href="https://twitter.com/dabit3">Nader Dabit</a> to get on a
              Zoom call and teach me how to use software he was working on. The
              format worked, so I kept setting up "one more session" with other
              guests — the show has

            <li>
              I met my partner, Marisa, in a period of my life when I was
              "absolutely not dating anyone because I'm moving away soon". We
              both had no intentions of getting into a relationship, and had
              multiple conversations early on about how nothing serious would
              happen between us. That was seven years ago, and we're still
              together (but, in fairness, we're rarely serious).

            For all that I've told myself I followed The Plan™, I'd be lying if
            I said I knew I'd end up where I am today. A huge amount of my life
            and my career has emerged as a result of drifting, and I'm extremely
            happy with the outcomes.

          <p>
            However, it's not always clear what the goal is, and that creates a
            challenge. Trying to be intentional when the requirements are
            unclear doesn't have the same payoff; you're pushing hard toward
            <em>somewhere</em>, but it's a lot of hard work going toward an
            unknown destination.

            In situations without clear goals, drifting allows us to exist in a
            space and see how things interact. If we give ourselves the space to
            observe how a situation is playing out, we start to learn more about
            it, and

                otherwise we're leaving too much up to chance.

            If we want to do something well, whether it's passing a test or
            learning a new skill, we can vastly improve our chances by studying.
            With something like a test, how we do this is pretty straightforward
            — but how do we "study" being successful, being happy, or building a
            great team?

            We can ask ourselves questions to gather information:

            <li>Where are the biggest opportunities for growth?</li>
            <li>Are there patterns to my (or my team's) behavior?</li>

          </ul>
          <p>
            By drifting, we can free up our mental bandwidth to ask questions
            and let patterns and opportunities emerge.
            <strong
              >Once we have enough information, we can switch back over to being

            Embracing both intention and drift can give us the ability to
            deliberately make progress toward our concrete goals while
            <em>also</em> allowing us the space to notice new opportunities.
